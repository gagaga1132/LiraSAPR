> LIRA-FEM implements Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology and is focused on design and calculation of building structures. Realization of BIM technology is provided by native connection with other architectural, calculation, graphic and documentation systems (SAPFIR-3D, Revit, Tekla, AutoCAD, ArchiCAD, Advance Steel, BoCAD, Allplan, STARK ES, Gmsh, etc.) based on DXF, MDB, STP, SLI, MSH, STL, OBJ, IFC, etc. files.

> user with the possibility of 3D visualization of the calculation scheme at all stages of synthesis and analysis. Powerful diagnostic system. Numerous types of presentation of the results of the problem solution - in graphical (isopoles, epiphases, deformed schemes, animation of vibration forms) and tabular (displacements, stresses, forces, RCS, RCN, results of selection of reinforcement in reinforced concrete elements and sections of steel elements) allows you to quickly perform the necessary analysis. Variant design mode - in one task the user can vary sections of elements, materials, standards.
